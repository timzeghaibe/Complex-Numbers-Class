# Complex-Numbers-Class

This program is split into two files, one header file which contains the definition of the Complex Numbers class and the methods; and a .cpp file which contains the realization of the methods of the class and the overloaded functions.

C++ program where I use Classes and overloaded operators to work with Complex Numbers


Input: two complex numbers in the form x+iy and seperated by a space.
Output: each line is a complex number resulting from the arithmetic operations on the two complex numbers received from the user.

Then a second request for input of two complex numbers with the same form, but now, to demonstrate the overloading of compund arithmetic assignments.
